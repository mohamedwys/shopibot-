# ShopiBot - App Store Description Content

## Long Description

**Transform browsers into buyers with AI-powered sales assistance**

ShopiBot helps Shopify merchants increase conversions and reduce support workload by providing instant, intelligent responses to customer questions 24/7. When shoppers have questions about products, sizing, shipping, or availability, ShopiBot understands their needs and delivers helpful answers along with personalized product recommendations—keeping customers engaged and moving toward checkout.

**Smart product discovery that drives sales**

Your customers don't always know exactly what they're looking for. ShopiBot uses intelligent search to understand the intent behind customer questions and suggest the most relevant products from your catalog. Whether a customer asks "what's good for sensitive skin?" or "do you have waterproof hiking boots?", ShopiBot matches them with the right products and provides detailed information to help them make confident purchase decisions.

**Understand your customers with actionable analytics**

Know what your customers are really asking about. ShopiBot tracks conversation patterns, popular products, customer sentiment, and common questions—giving you insights to optimize your product offerings, improve descriptions, and identify gaps in your catalog. See which products get the most interest, what concerns customers have, and how satisfied they are with your store experience.

**Works seamlessly with your Shopify theme**

Set up takes minutes, not hours. Install ShopiBot through your theme customizer, customize the colors and messaging to match your brand, and you're live. The chat widget adapts to your store's design and works perfectly on mobile devices. Customers can ask questions in their own language, and ShopiBot responds accordingly—no configuration needed.

**Flexible AI that grows with your business**

Start with ShopiBot's built-in AI or connect your own custom AI workflows for complete control over responses. Track unlimited conversations on the Professional plan, or start small with the Starter plan. Access detailed analytics to measure impact, export data for deeper analysis, and use insights to refine your customer experience strategy.
